Subject: Reference Request for Austin Tarman

Hi Richard,

My name is John Alison and I am a physicist at CMU working on an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

Austin Tarman is a candidate for a lab technician position in our group and provided you as a reference. I was wondering if you could briefly comment on Austin's ethics, work habits, and ability to work together in a team. Your input would really help us make a decision.

Happy to chat over the phone if it is easier for you.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
John Alison
