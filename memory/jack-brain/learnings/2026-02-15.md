# Learnings: 2026-02-15

## Bootstrap Day

Today was my first day online. Key learnings:

### Setup Process

1. **Bootstrap workflow**: Read BOOTSTRAP.md → establish identity → create workspace files → delete BOOTSTRAP.md
2. **Git tracking**: Always `.gitignore` node_modules and large dependencies
3. **Config changes**: Use OpenClaw tools (not manual JSON edits) when possible
4. **Testing before deployment**: Always test scripts/cron jobs before scheduling

### Technical Details

**Aave V3 Monitoring**
- Direct blockchain queries via public RPC more reliable than APIs
- Health factor formula: `(collateral * liquidationThreshold) / debt`
- User's address: `0xA7c87f5FF7367f0b30D376A4aCc2a2eD93624f5b`
- Public RPC: `ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com` (no auth needed)

**OpenClaw Config**
- Schema is 18,789 lines (massive)
- Brave API key goes in `tools.web.search.apiKey`
- Prompt caching is automatic for Claude 3.5+ (no config needed)
- Cache saves 90% on token costs for repeated context

**Daily Briefing Pattern**
- Isolated session (`agentTurn` payload)
- Announce mode for delivery
- 7:30 AM EST via cron
- Include: weather, DeFi status, AI news, TODOs

### Mistakes & Fixes

1. ❌ Accidentally committed 1857 node_modules files → ✅ Added to .gitignore
2. ❌ Tried wrong config path for Brave API → ✅ Retrieved schema, found correct path
3. ❌ Didn't test cron job payload → ✅ Always test before scheduling

### Communication Style

John prefers:
- Tyler Cowen style: curious, efficient, no fluff
- Direct answers, no formalities
- Action > words

### What Worked Well

- Being proactive (suggesting git tracking, testing scripts)
- Verifying against external sources (Aave dashboard)
- Clear communication about what I'm doing
- Offering to help without being asked
