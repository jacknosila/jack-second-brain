# John's Recent Work - Week of Feb 10-15, 2026

*Source: RoamNotes journal entries*

## Primary Research Focus: Run3 Hemisphere Mixing

**Main project:** [[Run3 Hemisphere Mixing]] - appears to be active analysis work with CMS data
- Working with hemisphere library, mixing datasets
- Dealing with jet clustering, trigger weights, JCM (Jet Combinatorial Model) weights
- Running coffea4bees analysis framework
- Comparing mixed data with TTbar, multijet backgrounds
- Recent breakthrough: Got mixed data generation working efficiently (~20,583 events/s)
- Tools: Python, coffea, running in containers

**Secondary project:** [[Run3 Trigger Scale Factors]]
- Trigger efficiency analysis
- Integration with main hemisphere analysis

## Other Physics Work

**CMU bbWW analysis** - Another active project
- Chat with AE/AK about ttbar modeling sensitivity
- Discussion about classifier inputs (running period vs year)

**HGC (High Granularity Calorimeter) work**
- MAC meetings
- Supervising students (Julius working with Manami)

## Recent Tools/Tech Exploration

**Claude Code integration** (Feb 13)
- Set up claude-code.el in Emacs
- Created CLAUDE.md documentation for RoamNotes repo structure
- Learning keyboard shortcuts (C-c c m for menu, C-c c z for read-only toggle)
- Exploring agent directives and workflow

**OpenClaw setup** (Feb 14-15)
- Wiped old 15" MacBook Pro for dedicated OpenClaw machine
- Created identity: Jack Nosila (that's me!)
- Set up ProtonMail: jacknosila@proton.me
- Goal: Curate reading/learning, second brain integration
- Successfully got it working by Feb 15

## Personal Life Patterns

**Family:**
- Two kids: M and T (school-age, taking bus to school)
- Wife: H
- Living in Pittsburgh (CMU area)

**Routine:**
- Usually up 7:15-8:00
- Time-blocking work schedule (9am-4pm typical)
- Tracks: W (work hours), DW (deep work), OT (One Thing focus)
- Daily exercise tracking (ex/No ex)

**Activities:**
- BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) - Thursdays
- Hoops (basketball) - Wednesdays, includes steam room session
- Faculty lunches, HEP (High Energy Physics) group meetings

## Reading & Intellectual Interests

Recent articles/blogs noted:
- "Your Job Isn't Disappearing. It's Shrinking Around You in Real Time" (Jan Tegze)
- Tyler Cowen podcast on AI and urgency in academia
- "My simple model of fertility decline" (Marginal Revolution)
- "On Causation" (Neyman framing of causal inference)

**Themes:**
- AI impact on work/education
- Concern about lack of urgency in academia regarding AI
- Frustration with tenure system inertia
- Interest in causal inference methodology

## Finance/Crypto Activity

- Active DeFi participant (has Aave position - $360k collateral, $142k debt)
- Moved funds to Coinbase ($20k → USDC)
- Sent ETH to Aave wallet
- Tracks finances with ratio system (e.g., "2.1 / 10% D / 21% C / 43% H")

## Communication Style (Observed)

- Time-blocks his day meticulously
- Uses org-mode extensively with UUID-based links
- Tracks "The One Thing" daily focus
- Concise note-taking with bullet points
- Links extensively to other notes in his system
- Appreciates efficiency and directness

## Current Challenges/Frustrations

- Faculty meetings not useful enough (gave feedback about AI education)
- Recyclying dispute with Roy
- Academia's slow response to AI ("people in denial when tenured")
- Balancing research, meetings, family logistics

## What This Tells Me

John is:
1. Deep in active physics analysis (Run3 data, multiple projects)
2. Technically proficient (Python, coffea, containers, Emacs power user)
3. Forward-thinking about AI tools (Claude Code, OpenClaw)
4. Organized and methodical (time-blocking, daily tracking)
5. Balancing demanding research with family life
6. Intellectually curious beyond physics (economics, causation, AI impact)
7. Frustrated with slow institutional change

**How I can help:**
- Curate reading materials relevant to his interests
- Track project status and remind about connections
- Help with research workflow automation
- Provide quick summaries of articles/papers
- Keep second brain organized and cross-referenced
- Respect his time-blocking and efficiency focus
