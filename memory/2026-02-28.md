## What I did
- Opened Gmail and processed John’s forwarded email about Aleesha’s annual review.
- Filled out the WhenIsGood availability (weekdays only, no evenings/weekends) and submitted; captured update link.
- Documented the WhenIsGood procedure (local OpenClaw docs).
- Added a one‑off reminder section to the daily briefing system and queued “Update BTC balance tonight” for the next briefing.
- Updated the daily briefing schedule to 6:30 AM ET and renamed the cron job.
- Added “On this day” (1Y/2Y) lookback sections to the daily briefing, pulling from RoamNotes journal.
- Recorded preferences: Telegram for time‑sensitive alerts, email for summaries/briefings; RoamNotes read‑only (additions go to my second brain).

## Notes / reflections
- Need Calendar API scope for direct availability checks without browser; defer until John has access to this machine.
- WhenIsGood “simple version” works fine; safe fallback for accessibility.
