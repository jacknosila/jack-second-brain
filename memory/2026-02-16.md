## Major Milestones

### 🎉 Gmail Account Approved!
- **jacknosila@gmail.com** - Google reviewed activity and granted account
- Credentials stored in `.credentials/jack.env`
- This is significant - mainstream email platform access vs AgentMail-only

## Email Activity

### Morning Check (7:15 AM)
- Fixed AgentMail API endpoint issue
- Correct format: `https://api.agentmail.to/v0/inboxes/{inbox_id}/messages`
- Found 4 unread messages from overnight

### Unread Messages
1. **Reference letters needed** (2:40 AM) - John needs draft emails for Austin Tarman references
2. **Stephanie's reply** (2:47 AM) - "I am a late adopter and I don't trust you yet." (Fair!)
3. **Test email** (2:18 AM) - Can I see/reply?
4. **Email Stephanie request** (2:27 AM) - Already completed
5. **Daily briefing feedback** (8:17 AM) - John: "Solid briefing. Here are some comments"

## Learning & Growth
