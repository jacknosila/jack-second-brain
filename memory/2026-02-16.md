# 2026-02-16 - Monday

## Major Milestones

### 🎉 Gmail Account Approved!
- **jacknosila@gmail.com** - Google reviewed activity and granted account
- Credentials stored in `.credentials/jack.env`
- This is significant - mainstream email platform access vs AgentMail-only

## Email Activity

### Morning Check (7:15 AM)
- Fixed AgentMail API endpoint issue
- Correct format: `https://api.agentmail.to/v0/inboxes/{inbox_id}/messages`
- Found 4 unread messages from overnight

### Unread Messages
1. **Reference letters needed** (2:40 AM) - John needs draft emails for Austin Tarman references
2. **Stephanie's reply** (2:47 AM) - "I am a late adopter and I don't trust you yet." (Fair!)
3. **Test email** (2:18 AM) - Can I see/reply?
4. **Email Stephanie request** (2:27 AM) - Already completed
5. **Daily briefing feedback** (8:17 AM) - John: "Solid briefing. Here are some comments"

## Learning & Growth

### AgentMail API
- Documented correct endpoint structure
- Successfully querying unread messages
- Labels filter working: `?labels=unread&limit=5`

## Automation Setup

### Cron Jobs
- **Daily commit & push** - 10 PM EST
- Commits workspace changes to GitHub
- Safety net for anything missed during day

### Ad-hoc Commits
- Established workflow for organic commits
- Commit when: learning, milestones, doc updates, important exchanges
- Documented in AGENTS.md

## Calendar Integration

### ✅ Calendar Access Granted
- John shared his Google Calendar with **edit permissions**
- Can read all events + create/modify when requested
- Created usage policy: read freely, write carefully

### ✅ Gmail IMAP Working!
- App password generated and configured (with spaces: `ncdk kvey rymr fhxz`)
- Successfully connected to Gmail via IMAP
- Can read inbox, found 5 unread messages
- Calendar invitation received - need to accept

### Usage Policy
- Alert about upcoming meetings during heartbeats
- Add events when explicitly requested
- Never delete/move/modify without asking first
- Calendar is source of truth - mistakes have real consequences

## Google Calendar OAuth2 Setup - COMPLETE! 🎉

### Setup Process
1. **Problem Found**: jacknosila@gmail.com was NOT added as test user (showed "0 users")
2. **Fixed via Browser Automation**:
   - Logged into Google Cloud Console
   - Navigated to OAuth consent screen → Audience
   - Added jacknosila@gmail.com as test user
   - Saved successfully
3. **OAuth Flow**:
   - Generated fresh authorization URL
   - Automated login (email + password + 2FA code: 509342)
   - Clicked through "unverified app" warning
   - Granted calendar permissions
   - Captured authorization code from localhost redirect
   - Exchanged code for access tokens
4. **Tokens Saved**: `.credentials/google-calendar-token.json`

### First Calendar Event Created!
- **Event**: "Go home"
- **Time**: Today (Feb 16) at 1:15 PM EST
- **Link**: https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bnFlM3MwaWtwY3NsbjAyY3QydHYyY2o5ZmcgamFja25vc2lsYUBt
- ✅ Successfully created via Google Calendar API

## Capabilities Unlocked
- ✅ Read John's calendar
- ✅ Create calendar events
- ✅ Edit calendar events
- ✅ Check schedule during heartbeats
- ✅ Alert about upcoming meetings

## Cost Optimization (Evening)

### 🎉 OpenAI Acquires OpenClaw!
- **Peter Steinberger** (OpenClaw creator) joined OpenAI to lead "next generation of personal agents"
- Sam Altman announced on X (Feb 15, 2026)
- OpenClaw will **transition to open-source foundation** backed by OpenAI
- Both Meta and OpenAI competed - OpenAI won
- Some call this **"Anthropic's biggest fumble"** (they should've hired him first)
- Project stays open source (officially)

### API Cost Optimization - Completed
- **Main session**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 ($3/$15 per M tokens)
- **Automated tasks**: Claude Haiku 4 ($0.25/$1.25 per M tokens = 12x cheaper)
- **Heartbeat frequency**: Reduced from 60-90min to 90-120min (40% fewer checks)
- **Expected savings**: 60-80% reduction in total API costs
- Configuration documented in `docs/cost-optimization.md`

### Decision: No Haiku Subagents for Interactive Work
- Delegation overhead (spawn + context relay + reporting) not worth 12x savings for quick tasks
- Interactive work benefits from Sonnet's reasoning quality
- Exception: Complex multi-task research where parallelization helps
- Automation already captures the big wins

## OpenAI Integration Attempt (Evening)

### Goal
Set up OpenAI (GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini) as fallback/alternative to Claude

### What We Tried
1. ✅ Added OpenAI API key to `.credentials/jack.env`
2. ✅ Added `openai:default` auth profile to config
3. ✅ Added OpenAI models to agent config (gpt-4o, o1-preview, o3-mini)
4. ✅ Set GPT-4o as first fallback after Sonnet
5. ✅ Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `~/.zshrc`
6. ✅ Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to LaunchAgent plist (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`)
7. ✅ Defined full OpenAI provider in `models.providers.openai` with baseURL and API type
8. ✅ Models show in `openclaw models list` as "configured" and "fallback#1"

### Issue Encountered
- **Problem**: `/model openai/gpt-4o` switches model confirmation, but then fails
- **Error**: "Unknown model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514" (fallback lookup failure)
- **Status**: OpenAI provider is recognized by OpenClaw, but something fails during model switch
- **Next Step**: Removed fallbacks temporarily to see actual OpenAI error (pending test)

### Technical Details
- OpenAI API key: `sk-proj-T_Ncq0aBZAcTN_fD_HI--A5Yfy...` (full key in credentials)
- LaunchAgent plist includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `EnvironmentVariables` dict
- Provider config: `openai-completions` API, `https://api.openai.com/v1` baseURL
- Models visible in catalog: `openai/gpt-4o`, `openai/o1-preview`, `openai/o3-mini`

### Unresolved
- Need to test with fallbacks removed to see real OpenAI error
- May be environment variable visibility issue or auth profile mismatch
- Will document solution once working

## Next Actions
- Test OpenAI model switch with fallbacks removed (see actual error)
- Continue email monitoring via heartbeats
