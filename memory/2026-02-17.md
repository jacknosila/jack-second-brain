### 07:30 - System Health Initiative
- John noticed he didn't receive daily briefing (scheduled for 7:30 AM, will arrive shortly)
- Gateway was restarted
- John requested a health status checklist system
- **Created:**
  - `HEALTH.md` - Manual health checklist with troubleshooting
  - `scripts/health-check.py` - Automated health check script
  - `scripts/x-top-posts.py` - Placeholder for X/Twitter integration
  - This daily note file

### Health Check Findings
- ✅ Cron jobs scheduled and running (Daily briefing, Daily commit)
- ✅ Email monitoring operational
- ✅ Git repository configured and tracking
- ⚠️ x-top-posts.py was missing (now created as placeholder)
- ⚠️ Need X API credentials for full Twitter integration

## Lessons Learned

- Post-restart verification is important
- Having automated health checks reduces manual work

## Next Steps
- [ ] Get X API credentials for twitter integration
- [ ] Test health check script after fixes
