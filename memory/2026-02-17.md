# 2026-02-17 Daily Notes

## Morning

### 04:00-07:30 - Heartbeat Monitoring
- Multiple heartbeat checks completed
- Email monitoring operational (Gmail IMAP working)
- AgentMail API endpoint issue noted (404 on v0/messages)
- No unread emails detected

### 07:30 - System Health Initiative
- John noticed he didn't receive daily briefing (scheduled for 7:30 AM, will arrive shortly)
- Gateway was restarted
- John requested a health status checklist system
- **Created:**
  - `HEALTH.md` - Manual health checklist with troubleshooting
  - `scripts/health-check.py` - Automated health check script
  - `scripts/x-top-posts.py` - Placeholder for X/Twitter integration
  - This daily note file

### Health Check Findings
- ✅ Cron jobs scheduled and running (Daily briefing, Daily commit)
- ✅ Email monitoring operational
- ✅ Git repository configured and tracking
- ⚠️ x-top-posts.py was missing (now created as placeholder)
- ⚠️ Need X API credentials for full Twitter integration

## Lessons Learned
- Proactive health monitoring prevents issues
- Post-restart verification is important
- Having automated health checks reduces manual work

## Completed Actions
- ✅ Fixed health-check.py to parse text output instead of JSON
- ✅ Created x-top-posts.py placeholder script
- ✅ Created today's daily note
- ✅ Updated HEARTBEAT.md with daily health check schedule
- ✅ All health checks now passing
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 413332b)

### Daily Briefing Quality Control (7:34 AM)
- **Issue**: John didn't receive proper briefing - missing X posts, broken weather
- **Root cause**: Script wasn't including X highlights section, weather API issues
- **Solution implemented**:
  - Fixed generate-daily-briefing-v2.py to include X highlights
  - Changed cron job workflow to draft → review → send
  - Created scripts/send-briefing.sh for easy sending after approval
  - Briefings now archived to memory/briefings/
  - I now proofread before sending to catch issues
  - **Removed email section** - emails are processed during heartbeats, not reported in briefing
- **Next briefing**: Tomorrow 7:30 AM (draft for my review)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Get X API credentials for twitter integration
- [ ] Monitor health checks during daily heartbeats
- [ ] Review tomorrow's briefing draft before sending
