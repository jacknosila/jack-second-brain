# 2026-02-15 - First Contact & Setup

## Bootstrap Conversation

**08:45** - I came online, fresh workspace
**08:48** - Met John Alison, physicist at CMU working on CMS at LHC
- He spent significant time setting me up
- Excited to start working together
- Named me Jack Nosila
- Role: teacher, helper, builder

**08:52** - Defined our vibe
- Tyler Cowen style: curious, efficient, no fluff, connecting ideas
- Starting with simple assistant tasks
- Goal: help build second brain, teach/learn new things
- Emoji: ⚡

## Setup Work Today

**09:00-09:30** - System configuration
- Set up caffeinate to keep Mac awake
- Auto-hide Dock
- Installed & tested Caffeine app (doesn't work for lid-close)
- Installed Telegram Desktop
- Git-tracked the workspace

**09:30-10:00** - Daily briefing setup
- Created Aave V3 health checker script (checks health factor, collateral, debt)
- Configured daily summary for 7:30 AM with:
  - Weather (Pittsburgh)
  - Aave V3 status
  - Top AI headline
  - Yesterday's events & TODOs
- Installed Himalaya email CLI (not configured yet)
- Set up Brave Search API key for AI headlines

## Pending Tasks

- Address Anthropic API rate limits

## Notes
- John's Aave address: 0xA7c87f5FF7367f0b30D376A4aCc2a2eD93624f5b
- Current health factor: 2.05 (healthy)

## Afternoon Progress (15:00-15:20)

**Configuration & Troubleshooting**
- Retrieved OpenClaw config schema (18,789 lines) to understand Brave API setup
- Identified correct config path: `tools.web.search.apiKey` (sensitive string field)
- Brave API key confirmed: `BSAKkI3KLzmDu1mY_jv0WOh-wtzRyDKiQtb`
- Git .gitignore updated to exclude node_modules (after accidental 1857 file commit)

**Infrastructure**
- Aave monitoring script location: `/Users/jacknosila/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/check-aave-health.js`
- Daily briefing cron job ID: `3a73deb3-d9f8-4fc0-95b5-f15ea5b62291`
- TODO.md created for task tracking
- Uses public RPC: `ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com` (no API keys needed)

**Status Update**
- ✅ Bootstrap complete (IDENTITY.md, USER.md)
- ✅ Daily briefing system configured and tested
- ✅ Aave health monitoring working (verified against dashboard)
- 🔄 Brave API configuration in progress (need to apply using correct schema)
- ⏸️ Amphetamine installation postponed (user decision)
- ⏸️ Gmail for Jack delayed (not urgent)

**Key Decisions**
- Aave monitoring: Direct blockchain queries (reliable, no auth)
- Daily briefing: Telegram announce at 7:30 AM EST
- Git tracking: Workspace versioned, node_modules excluded
- Email: Creating separate Gmail later

## System Info
