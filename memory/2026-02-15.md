# 2026-02-15 - Setup Session

## Major Progress

### GitHub Identity Established
- Created GitHub account: jacknosila
- SSH key generated and added to GitHub (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519_jack`)
- GitHub CLI authenticated with PAT (stored in `.credentials/jack.env`)
- SSH authentication working (`ssh -T git@github.com` successful)

### RoamNotes Access & Exploration
- Accepted invitation to John's private RoamNotes repository
- Cloned to `/Users/jacknosila/.openclaw/workspace/RoamNotes`
- **System**: Org-roam (Emacs), 1,267 notes with UUID-based links, 650 journal entries
- Read CLAUDE.md for repository guidelines
- Explored recent journal entries (Feb 6-15, 2026)

### John's Research Context (from journal review)
- **Main project**: Run3 Hemisphere Mixing (CMS analysis using coffea4bees)
- **Also working on**: Run3 Trigger Scale Factors, CMU bbWW, HGC work
- **Collaborators**: AE (postdoc), AK (grad student), Julius (UG), Manami, Lipika, Lei, Kungmin
- Created summary: `memory/jack-brain/context/john-recent-work.md`

### John's Reading Patterns (from Books.org)
- 30-50 books/year since 2007
- Major influences: Tyler Cowen, Bryan Caplan, Yuval Harari, Feynman, Weinberg
- Current focus: Shakespeare, physics review, project management
- Reviewed detailed notes from "21 Lessons" with UUID cross-references
- Created: `memory/jack-brain/context/john-reading-patterns.md`

### Second Brain Philosophy Established
- **Decision**: Keep Jack's brain and John's brain SEPARATE but connected
- Jack reads John's notes for context/understanding
- Jack's brain (`memory/jack-brain/`) is for Jack's own learning and growth
- John's RoamNotes is his thinking/research/life - no imposing structure
- Updated USER.md with this philosophy

### Calendar Access
- Found existing gcal.org file (266KB, synced via org-gcal)
- Read-only access sufficient for awareness
- Can parse for upcoming events in daily briefings
- Demonstrated reading Feb 16-27 events

### Email Progress - AgentMail Setup ✅
- Jack's ProtonMail: jacknosila@proton.me (password in `.credentials/jack.env`)
- AgentMail account created and verified
- API key generated: `am_us_5b...` (stored in `.credentials/jack.env`)
- Inbox: **jacknosila@agentmail.to** (old plainprofession41 inbox removed)
- Python SDK installed in venv (`.venv/`)
- Can now send and receive emails via AgentMail API
- Daily briefing configured to send via email (7:30 AM EST to johnda102@gmail.com)

## Key Learnings

1. **Org-roam structure**: UUID-based note IDs, bidirectional links, journal entries in separate directory
2. **John's work style**: Detailed daily journals with time blocks, extensive cross-referencing, disciplined reading tracker
3. **Collaboration boundary**: Jack runs on dedicated MacBook, John on separate machine - GitHub is collaboration layer
4. **Security boundary**: No access to John's personal Gmail/Google accounts
5. **Knowledge management**: John's system is mature (1,267 notes, 2,434 commits) - learn from it, don't disrupt it

## Next Session Priorities
1. ~~Complete AgentMail signup~~ ✅ DONE
2. Add calendar awareness to daily briefing (parse gcal.org)
3. Test sending/receiving email via AgentMail API
4. Continue reading John's journal to stay current on his work
5. Test full daily briefing tomorrow (7:30 AM)

## Files Created/Modified
- `.credentials/jack.env` - GitHub PAT and AgentMail credentials added
- `memory/jack-brain/context/john-recent-work.md` - Research summary
- `memory/jack-brain/context/john-reading-patterns.md` - Reading analysis
- `USER.md` - Updated with second brain philosophy
- `TODO.md` - Updated progress tracking

## Email Monitoring Setup (Evening)

### New Capability: Regular Inbox Monitoring

## Daily Briefing Enhancement (Late Evening)

### New Sections Added
John requested two additions to the 7:30 AM daily briefing:

**1. Historical Snapshot**
- Pick a random past month from RoamNotes/Journal/
- Read 2-3 entries from that month
- Summarize what John was working on
- Extract key insights and patterns
- Provides long-term context and memory refresher

**2. Suggestions for Today**
- 1-2 specific, actionable task ideas
- Based on TODO.md, recent work patterns, or efficiency improvements
- Could include software/scripts I could write
- Shows proactive value and initiative

### Test Briefing Sent
- Created sample briefing with new sections
- Historical snapshot: July 2025 (PGSS teaching, Run2 HH4b, HGC work)
- Suggestions: Calendar integration script, RoamNotes search tool
- Updated cron job timeout to 180s (more processing needed)
- Full enhanced briefing starts tomorrow at 7:30 AM

### Journal Structure Discovered
- Located in `RoamNotes/Journal/YYYY/MM-Month/DD-Month-YYYY-Day.org`
- 650+ daily journal entries with structured time blocks
- Rich context: projects, meetings, reading, exercise tracking
- Perfect for historical snapshots and pattern analysis
