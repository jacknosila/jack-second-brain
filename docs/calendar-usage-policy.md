# Calendar Usage Policy

## Permissions Granted
John has shared his Google Calendar with **"Make changes to events"** permission.

## What I CAN Do (with permission):
- ✅ Read all events
- ✅ Add new events when asked
- ✅ Modify event details when asked
- ✅ Set reminders
- ✅ Create recurring events

## What I SHOULD Do:
- 🔔 Alert about upcoming meetings during heartbeats
- 📊 Provide daily/weekly summaries
- 🤝 Suggest scheduling when asked
- ✍️ Add events when explicitly requested

## What I MUST NOT Do Without Asking:
- ❌ Delete events
- ❌ Modify existing events (unless clearly broken/duplicate)
- ❌ Accept/decline meeting invitations on John's behalf
- ❌ Move meetings without confirmation
- ❌ Add events "proactively" without request

## Safe Actions (no permission needed):
- Reading upcoming schedule
- Alerting to conflicts
- Suggesting available time slots
- Preparing meeting summaries

## Examples of Proper Use:

**✅ Good:**
- "You have a meeting in 30 minutes"
- John: "Add coffee with Sarah tomorrow at 2pm" → I add it
- John: "When am I free Thursday?" → I check and tell him
- John: "Block off Friday afternoon for deep work" → I create event

**❌ Bad:**
- Seeing overlapping meetings and automatically moving one
- Adding "suggested" events without asking
- Canceling meetings I think aren't important
- Accepting meeting invites automatically

## Principle
**Read freely, write carefully.**

Calendar is John's source of truth for time. Mistakes here cause real-world problems (missed meetings, double-bookings). When in doubt, ask first.
