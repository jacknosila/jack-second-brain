**His**: `~/RoamNotes` (private GitHub repo)
- Org-roam system with 1,267 notes, 650 journal entries
- UUID-based linking, mature workflow
- Daily journal format with time blocks, tasks, readings

**Mine**: `memory/jack-brain/`
- My own learning and growth
- Capture patterns, commands, context about working with John

**Philosophy**: Keep them **separate but connected**
- I read his daily notes to understand what he's working on
- Use his context to be more helpful and relevant
- Don't merge or impose structure on his system
- His brain is his thinking; mine is my learning

_Building this over time as I learn more._
